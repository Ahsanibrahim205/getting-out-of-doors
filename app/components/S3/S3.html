                            <li>Insufficient daylight may cause psychological health problems, in certain people,
                            because of its effect on the production of the hormone melatonin. </li>
                        <li>Melatonin is released from the pineal gland (a pea-size structure at the centre of
                            the brain) after several hours of darkness and it is presumed to be one of the
                            bodyâ€™s chemicals involved in causing us to feel sleepy.</li>
                        <li>When daylight comes, the brain inhibits the secretion of melatonin and the period
                            of wakefulness begins. </li>
                        <li>Evidence suggests that individuals with SAD have a longer period of melatonin
                            production at night in the winter. In addition, SAD sufferers may have higher
                            daytime melatonin levels during winter, compared to those without SAD.</li>
                        <li>Alternative theories suggest that it is the lack of serotonin, which is a
                            characteristic of people in depressive states. </li>
                        <li>Serotonin is produced when adequate light is available.</li>
                        <p>The negative impact of insufficient daylight on psychological health has been termed:
                            seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

                                <li>Your knowing that daylight is associated to varying degrees with the mental wellbeing of an individual should make you more conscious of the need to make daily
                                    efforts to take a dosage of sunlight whenever possible. </li>
                                <li>The most obvious and cheap solution is, each day, to take a bath of daylight for
                                    about 15 to 30 minutes or at least seek out whatever daylight is available</li>
                                <li>You can buy special lights to provide this daylight effect indoors. </li>
                                <li>These lights offer generally about 10 to 50 times the intensity of normal indoor
                                    lighting. </li>
                                <li>Exposure to the light of these lamps is usually recommended to be in sessions of
                                    about 30 minutes with a maximum time of around 2 hours per day </li>
                                <li>Certainly consulting a doctor, or other specialised health professional, is highly
                                    recommended if you believe you might be experiencing SAD symptoms to such
                                    an extent that you are feeling negative about your wellness levels. </li>
